"""
Example
1. Set the robot in teaching mode
2. Record the trajectory (in RL the left arm will just drop down, on the real robot the user can move it in
gravity compensation)
3. The arm will be brought to its initial position
4. The recorded trajectory will be imitated.

Everything will happen in the cartesian space.
